Tacit programming, also called point-free style, is a programming paradigm in which function definitions do not identify the arguments (or "points") on which they operate. Instead the definitions merely compose other functions, among which are combinators that manipulate the arguments. Tacit programming is of theoretical interest, because the strict use of composition results in programs that are well adapted for equational reasoning.[1] It is also the natural style of certain programming languages, including APL and its derivatives,[2] and concatenative languages such as Forth. The lack of argument naming gives point-free style a reputation of being unnecessarily obscure, hence the epithet "pointless style".[1]

UNIX scripting uses the paradigm with pipes.

For example, a sequence of operations in an applicative language such as the following:
